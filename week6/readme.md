TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Mid term break: I decided to get a start on the week 5 work which is scheduled for week 7 and also start on my data project.

        The week 5 work was a bit more complex than previous weeks. A few times I had to tweak the mini test code for the koch
        exercised so I could see how the function was formed and I used this website as well https://python-with-science.readthedocs.io/en/latest/koch_fractal/koch_fractal.html.

        I continued using the basic pandas to gain a bit more of an understanding of what each plot option does.
