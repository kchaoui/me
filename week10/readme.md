TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

As part of my data project, I need to find further data on the land area per zip code. While looking as the minimum values and googling them, it appeared that the zip code with a very low population and park count had a low land area. To normalize the data, I need to either normalize it to find parks per 10000 people or parks per 1 km^2
