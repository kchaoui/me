TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Week 5 Exercises:
These exercises were okay to complete once I understoof what I was trying to do 

    Notes:

    I'm still stuck on wordy_pyramid, I keep on getting the api_key message when I run the test, I removed it and it worked. Unsure if this is the correct thing to do. Same issue with another exercise, I had to remove guard in apply_rules to make it word, guard is not used within that function, only outside of it.

    The fractals was interesting, did a bit of reading on how they work with the angles and movement of the drawing. I slowed down the speed so I could see how it worked.

    Only test I'm failing is the first countdown, but the numbers don't match up. Other's have noted the same issue.
