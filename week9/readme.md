TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week I'm focussing on my data project, things to include are:
- overlay a graph of average family age over the number of parks rec facilities zip code
- overlay a graph of average family size over the number of parks per rec facilities code
- bubble map of the number of parks per zip code

- I need to figure out how to colour coordinate according to the rec facility type so when plotting on the map or bar chart, the colours correspond to a certain type of facility
