TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

python ../course/week4/tests.py

### Exercise 1:
    get_some_details
        - data["results"][0]["name"]["last"]
        this accesses the data, into results then name then last
        - need to follow the sequence of Json files

    wordy_pyramid
        problems: every word was formatted with a b in front e.g. "b'quacksalver'". This b needed to be removed, use the .split ("'")function to split the output into individual parts and select the second part to isolate the word
        
        .content pulls the word from the website and makes it a string
        .split = split a string into a list where each word is a list item
        .extent = adds all elements of an iterable list to the end of the list
        .reverse = revereses elemnts of the list

    pokedex
        status_code is 200 (means okay)
        status_code is 404 (means error)

    diarist
        .count() : counts the number of times a certain item occurs
        I followed the IOexmaples to make the code but had to look at other people's code for the LOCAL part

        General Details:
        - published by the City of New York 
        - Angency - Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR)
        - created by NYC Parksâ€™ Innovation and Performance Management
        - purpose was to generate a dataset of Childrens Play Areas from NYC parks
        - created 8 April 2020, updated June 3 2020

        Edit: I did some random checks on the data and determined that the zip codes were incorrect and leading also other incorrect location data e.g. polic precinct

 ### Data Project - Second Option       
    I liked the idea of looking at playgrounds and LA had similar data

        Things to look at:
            compare both sets of data to determine correlation
